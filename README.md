# vacc_simulation

This project is an assignment for my Operating Systems class. 
It's a simple command line program with the purpose of modifying and storing data, and running a simulation about vaccination.
The user has the opportunity to "sign up" for a vaccine, and after submitting appropriate data, their information gets stored in a file.
There are further options to modify, delete and list the current data.

Through this assignment, I could familiarise myself with processes, pipes, and more.
